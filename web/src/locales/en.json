We are a motivated group of students who represent and defend the opinion of all students within our university. Because we are active within various organisms within our university, we have a say on different levels. This ranges from small organisms, such as the 'Food Committee' and the 'Library Policy Committee', to the highest, such as the 'Education council' and the 'UHasselt Board of Directors'. Because of this participation, we are seen as the co-administration of the university.<br><br>StuRa exists since 2004 and has always been actively solving problems and defending the opinion of students within the university. Feel free to read our reports or our list of projects to see what we are currently doing! You can always reach StuRa by contacting members, by visiting our open General Meetings, or through our 'Stuver' consultations, where each faculty coordinator meets the students from the evaluation meetings and OMTs.",

                    "description": "Many students from other cities think our night life is just counting sheep and milking cows, but it's the exact opposite! In Diepenbeek, you can go out in Fitlink, Borly or 't Stiemerke, and Hasselt has many bars.<br>Yet, students still miss a place that neighbors approve of, and where they can do more than partying. For example, practise their hobbies. Many students that play music instruments can't practice in their dorm because of the thin walls. Other things that can be integrated in this place are a small store, or additional study places.<br>Student Hotspot is the solution for all these issues. It'll be a multifunctional and cosy, but above all student-friendly place, created and maintained by and for students. Right now, we are trying to involve the municipalities of Hasselt and Diepenbeek in the project. We're also looking for a suited location. Hopefully, we can all enjoy this place next year allready!"
